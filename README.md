iOS Tip Calculator written in Swift for CodePath

This is a simple Tip Calculator that I wrote after watching this video: http://vimeo.com/102084767

Some of the features that I added:

  - ATM-like input for the bill amount (e.g., for $150.15 the user types 1-5-0-1-5)
  - Locale-specific currency ($, £, €, etc) and thousands separators
  - 10-minute memory of the last used bill amount and tip amount across app restarts
  - Adds a settings page to allow customization of the tip amounts used
  - Add light/dark color themes to the settings page
